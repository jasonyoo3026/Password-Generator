# Project: Creating Password Generator

## Description

The aim of this project was to construct an application which can generate random passwords based on the selected criteria. This website has responsive user interface that can be compatible with multiple screen sizes.


## Expected behaviours

```
I need a new, secure password!
- click the button to generate a password, then I am presented with a series of prompts for password criteria.
- When prompted for password criteria are presented,then I select which criteria to include in the password.
- When prompted for the length of the password are shown, then I choose a length of at least 8 characters and no more than 128 characters
- When asked for character types to include in the password, I confirm whether or not to include lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters
- when I answer each prompt, my input should be validated and at least one character type should be selected.
- when all prompts are answered, a password is generated that matches the selected criteria.
- when the password is generated, the password is either displayed in an alert or written to the page.
```
